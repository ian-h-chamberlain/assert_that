Helpers for use with [`predicates`](https://crates.io/crates/predicates).
This crate's core macro prints more detailed output on failure than
`assert!`, using output from [`predicates-tree`](https://crates.io/crates/predicates-tree).

Inspired in part by [Google Mock matchers](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/cheat_sheet.md#matchers-matcherlist).

## Usage

See [this crate's documentation](https://docs.rs/assert_that) for examples.
